    \end{enumempty}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item When it is observed that the Mode A code shown on the situation display is different to what has been assigned to the aircraft, the pilot shall be requested to confirm the code selected and, if the situation warrants (e.g. not being a case of unlawful interference), to reselect the correct code.
        \item If the discrepancy between assigned and displayed Mode A codes still persists, the pilot may be requested to stop the operation of the aircraft’s transponder. The next control position and any other affected unit using SSR and/or MLAT in the provision of ATS shall be informed accordingly.
        %Review
        \item Aircraft equipped with Mode S having an aircraft identification feature shall transmit the aircraft identification as specified in Item 7 of the ICAO flight plan or, when no flight plan has been filed, the aircraft registration.

        \textit{Note --- All Mode S-equipped aircraft engaged in international civil aviation are required to have an aircraft identification feature (Annex 10, Volume IV, Chapter 2, 2.1.5.2, refers).}
        
        \item Whenever it is observed on the situation display that the aircraft identification transmitted by a Mode S-equipped aircraft is different from that expected from the aircraft, the pilot shall be requested to confirm and, if necessary, re-enter the correct aircraft identification.
        \item If, following confirmation by the pilot that the correct aircraft identification has been set on the Mode S identification feature, the discrepancy continues to exist, the following actions shall be taken by the controller:

        \begin{enumalph}
            \item inform the pilot of the persistent discrepancy;
            \item where possible, correct the label showing the aircraft identification on the situation display; and

        %Review
        \item Aircraft equipped with ADS-B having an aircraft identification feature shall transmit the aircraft identification as specified in Item 7 of the ICAO flight plan or, when no flight plan has been filed, the aircraft registration.
        \item Whenever it is observed on the situation display that the aircraft identification transmitted by an ADS-B-equipped aircraft is different from that expected from the aircraft, the pilot shall be requested to confirm and, if necessary, re-enter the correct aircraft identification.
        \item If, following confirmation by the pilot that the correct aircraft identification has been set on the ADS-B identification feature, the discrepancy continues to exist, the following actions shall be taken by the controller:

        \begin{enumalph}
            \item inform the pilot of the persistent discrepancy;
            \item where possible, correct the label showing the aircraft identification on the situation display; and

        \end{enumalph}
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection[Level information based on the use of pressure-altitude information]{Level information based on the \\ use of pressure-altitude information}

    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.2cm]\centering
        \item \textsc{Verification of level information}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The tolerance value used to determine that pressure-altitude-derived level information displayed to the controller is accurate shall be $\pm$200 ft in RVSM airspace. In other airspace, it shall be $\pm$300 ft, except that the appropriate ATS authority may specify a smaller criterion, but not less than $\pm$200 ft, if this is found to be more practical. Geometric height information shall not be used for separation.
            \item Verification of pressure-altitude-derived level information displayed to the controller shall be effected at least once by each suitably equipped ATC unit on initial contact with the aircraft concerned or, if this is not feasible, as soon as possible thereafter. The verification shall be effected by simultaneous comparison with altimeter-derived level information received from the same aircraft by radiotelephony. The pilot of the aircraft whose pressure-altitude-derived level information is within the approved tolerance value need not be advised of such verification. Geometric height information shall not be used to determine if altitude differences exist.
            \item If the displayed level information is not within the approved tolerance value or when a discrepancy in excess of the approved tolerance value is detected subsequent to verification, the pilot shall be advised accordingly and requested to check the pressure setting and confirm the aircraft’s level.
            \item If, following confirmation of the correct pressure setting the discrepancy continues to exist, the following action should be taken according to circumstances:

            \begin{enumalph}
                \item request the pilot to stop Mode C or ADS-B altitude data transmission, provided this does not cause the loss of position and identity information, and notify the next control positions or ATC unit concerned with the aircraft of the action taken; or
                \item inform the pilot of the discrepancy and request that the relevant operation continue in order to prevent loss of position and identity information of the aircraft and, when authorized by the appropriate ATS authority, override the label-displayed level information with the reported level. Notify the next control position or ATC unit concerned with the aircraft of the action taken.
            \end{enumalph}
        \end{enumerate}

        \item \textsc{Determination of level occupancy}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The criterion which shall be used to determine that a specific level is occupied by an aircraft shall be $\pm$200 ft in RVSM airspace. In other airspace, it shall be $\pm$300 ft, except that the appropriate ATS authority may specify a smaller criterion, but not less than $\pm$200 ft, if this is found to be more practical.

            \textit{Note --- For a brief explanation of the considerations underlying this value, see the \emph{Air Traffic Services Planning Manual} (Doc 9426).}

            %References
            \item \textit{Aircraft maintaining a level.} An aircraft is considered to be maintaining its assigned level as long as the pressure-altitude-derived level information indicates that it is within the appropriate tolerances of the assigned level, as specified in 8.5.5.2.1.
            \item \textit{Aircraft vacating a level.} An aircraft cleared to leave a level is considered to have commenced its manoeuvre and vacated the previously occupied level when the pressure-altitude-derived level information indicates a change of more than 300 ft in the anticipated direction from its previously assigned level.
            \item \textit{Aircraft passing a level in climb or descent.} An aircraft in climb or descent is considered to have crossed a level when the pressure-altitude-derived level information indicates that it has passed this level in the required direction by more than 300 ft.
            %References
            \item \textit{Aircraft reaching a level.} An aircraft is considered to have reached the level to which it has been cleared when the elapsed time of three display updates, three sensor updates or 15 seconds, whichever is the greater, has passed since the pressure-altitude-derived level information has indicated that it is within the appropriate tolerances of the assigned level, as specified in 8.5.5.2.1.
            \item Intervention by a controller shall only be required if differences in level information between that displayed to the controller and that used for control purposes are in excess of the values stated above.
