\subsubsection{Transfer of responsibility for the provision of \\ flight information service}

%References
The responsibility for the provision of flight information service to a flight normally passes from the appropriate ATS unit in an FIR to the appropriate ATS unit in the adjacent FIR at the time of crossing the common FIR boundary. However, when coordination is required in accordance with Chapter 10, 10.2, but communication facilities are inadequate, the former ATS unit shall, as far as practicable, continue to provide flight information service to the flight until it has established two-way communication with the appropriate ATS unit in the FIR it is entering.

\subsubsection{Transmission of information}

\begin{enumeratesc}
    \item \textsc{Means of transmission}
    \begin{enumerate}
        %References
        \item Except as provided in 9.1.3.2.1, information shall be disseminated to aircraft by one or more of the following means as determined by the appropriate ATS authority:
        \begin{enumalph}
            \item the preferred method of directed transmission on the initiative of the appropriate ATS unit to an aircraft, ensuring that receipt is acknowledged; or
            \item a general call, unacknowledged transmission to all aircraft concerned; or
            \item broadcast; or
            \item data link.
        \end{enumalph}

        \note{It should be recognized that in certain circumstances, e.g. during the last stages of a final approach, it may be impracticable for aircraft to acknowledge directed transmissions.}
        \item The use of general calls shall be limited to cases where it is necessary to disseminate essential information to several aircraft without delay, e.g. the sudden occurrence of hazards, a change of the runway-in-use, or the failure of a key approach and landing aid.
    \end{enumerate}
