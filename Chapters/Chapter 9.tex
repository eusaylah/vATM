%References
The responsibility for the provision of flight information service to a flight normally passes from the appropriate ATS unit in an FIR to the appropriate ATS unit in the adjacent FIR at the time of crossing the common FIR boundary. However, when coordination is required in accordance with Chapter 10, 10.2, but communication facilities are inadequate, the former ATS unit shall, as far as practicable, continue to provide flight information service to the flight until it has established two-way communication with the appropriate ATS unit in the FIR it is entering.

\subsubsection{Transmission of information}

\begin{enumeratesc}
    \itemsc{Means of transmission}
    \begin{enumerate}
        %References
        \item \label{9.1.3.1.1} Except as provided in 9.1.3.2.1, information shall be disseminated to aircraft by one or more of the following means as determined by the appropriate ATS authority:
        \begin{enumalph}
            \item the preferred method of directed transmission on the initiative of the appropriate ATS unit to an aircraft, ensuring that receipt is acknowledged; or
            \item a general call, unacknowledged transmission to all aircraft concerned; or
            \item broadcast; or
            \item data link.
        \end{enumalph}

        \note{It should be recognized that in certain circumstances, e.g. during the last stages of a final approach, it may be impracticable for aircraft to acknowledge directed transmissions.}
        \item The use of general calls shall be limited to cases where it is necessary to disseminate essential information to several aircraft without delay, e.g. the sudden occurrence of hazards, a change of the runway-in-use, or the failure of a key approach and landing aid.
    \end{enumerate}

    \itemsc{Transmission of special air-reports, \\ SIGMET and AIRMET information}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Appropriate SIGMET and AIRMET information, as well as special air-reports which have not been used for the preparation of a SIGMET, shall be disseminated to aircraft by one or more of the means specified in \ref{9.1.3.1.1} as determined on the basis of regional air navigation agreements. Special air-reports shall be disseminated to aircraft for a period of 60 minutes after their issuance.
        \item The special air-report, SIGMET and AIRMET information to be passed to aircraft on ground initiative should cover a portion of the route up to one hour’s flying time ahead of the aircraft except when another period has been determined on the basis of regional air navigation agreements.
    \end{enumerate}

    \itemsc{Transmission of information concerning \\ volcanic activity}
    \begin{enumempty}
        \item Information concerning pre-eruption volcanic activity, volcanic eruptions and volcanic ash clouds (position of clouds and flight levels affected) shall be disseminated to aircraft by one or more of the means specified in \ref{9.1.3.1.1} as determined on the basis of regional air navigation agreements.
    \end{enumempty}

    \itemsc{Transmission of information concerning \\ radioactive materials and toxic chemical clouds}
    \begin{enumempty}
        \item Information on the release into the atmosphere of radioactive materials or toxic chemicals which could affect airspace within the area of responsibility of the ATS unit shall be transmitted to aircraft by one or more of the means specified in \ref{9.1.3.1.1}.
    \end{enumempty}

    \itemsc{Transmission of SPECI and amended TAF}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Special reports in the SPECI code form and amended TAF shall be transmitted on request and supplemented by:
        \begin{enumalph}
            \item directed transmission from the appropriate air traffic services unit of selected special reports and amended TAF for the departure, destination and its alternate aerodromes, as listed in the flight plan; or
            \item a general call on appropriate frequencies for the unacknowledged transmission to affected aircraft of selected special reports and amended TAF; or
            %\item continuous or frequent broadcast or the use of data link to make available current METAR and TAF in areas determined on the basis of regional air navigation agreements where traffic congestion dictates. VOLMET broadcasts and/or D-VOLMET should be used to serve this purpose (see Annex 11, 4.4).
        \end{enumalph}

        \item The passing of amended aerodrome forecasts to aircraft on the initiative of the appropriate air traffic services unit should be limited to that portion of the flight where the aircraft is within a specified time from the aerodrome of destination, such time being established on the basis of regional air navigation agreements.

\subsubsection{Air traffic advisory service}

\begin{enumeratesc}
    \itemsc{Objective and basic principles}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The objective of the air traffic advisory service is to make information on collision hazards more effective than it would be in the mere provision of flight information service. It may be provided to aircraft conducting IFR flights in advisory airspace or on advisory routes (Class F airspace). Such areas or routes will be specified by the State concerned.
        \item Taking into account the considerations detailed in 2.4 of Annex 11, air traffic advisory service should only be implemented where the air traffic services are inadequate for the provision of air traffic control, and the limited advice on collision hazards otherwise provided by flight information service will not meet the requirement. Where air traffic advisory service is implemented, this should be considered normally as a temporary measure only until such time as it can be replaced by air traffic control service.
        \item Air traffic advisory service does not afford the degree of safety and cannot assume the same responsibilities as air traffic control service in respect of the avoidance of collisions, since information regarding the disposition of traffic in the area concerned available to the unit providing air traffic advisory service may be incomplete. To make this quite clear, air traffic advisory service does not deliver “clearances” but only “advisory information” and it uses the word “advise” or “suggest” when a course of action is proposed to an aircraft.

        \noindent IFR flights electing to use or required by the appropriate ATS authority on the basis of regional air navigation agreements to use the air traffic advisory service when operating within Class F airspace are expected to comply with the same procedures as those applying to controlled flights except that:

        \begin{enumalph}
            \item the flight plan and changes thereto are not subjected to a clearance, since the unit furnishing air traffic advisory service will only provide advice on the presence of essential traffic or suggestions as to a possible course of action;
            \note[1]{It is assumed that a pilot will not effect a change in the current flight plan until he or she has notified the intended change to the appropriate ATS unit and, if practicable, has received acknowledgement or relevant advice.}
            \note[2]{When a flight is operating or about to operate in a control area to continue eventually into an advisory area or along an advisory route, a clearance may be issued for the whole route, but the clearance as such, or revisions thereto, applies only to those portions of the flight conducted within control areas and control zones (3.7.4.4 of Annex 11). Advice or suggestions would be provided as necessary for the remaining portion of the route.}
            \item it is for the aircraft to decide whether or not it will comply with the advice or suggestion received and to inform the unit providing air traffic advisory service, without delay, of its decision;
            \item air-ground contacts shall be made with the air traffic services unit designated to provide air traffic advisory service within the advisory airspace or portion thereof.

        \itemscit{Aircraft not using the air traffic advisory service}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Aircraft wishing to conduct IFR flights within advisory airspace, but not electing to use the air traffic advisory service, shall nevertheless submit a flight plan, and notify changes made thereto to the unit providing that service.
            %References
            \note{See Chapter 4, 4.4.2, for procedures governing submission of a flight plan.}
            \item IFR flights intending to cross an advisory route should do so as nearly as possible at an angle of 90 degrees to the direction of the route and at a level, appropriate to its track, selected from the tables of cruising levels prescribed for use by IFR flights operating outside controlled airspace.

        \note{The efficiency of air traffic advisory service will depend largely on the procedures and practices in use. Its establishment in line with the organization, procedures and equipment of area control service, taking into account the basic differences of the two services, as indicated in 9.1.4.2.1, will help to ensure a high degree of efficiency and promote uniformity in the various provisions of air traffic advisory service. For example, exchange of information by the units concerned on the progress of an aircraft from one advisory area into an adjacent control area or terminal control area, and vice versa, will help to relieve pilots from repeating details of their flight plans already filed; also, use of standard air traffic control phraseology, preceded by the word \textup{“suggest”} or \textup{“advise”}, will facilitate the pilot’s understanding of air traffic advisory service intelligence.}
    \end{enumempty}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item An air traffic services unit providing air traffic advisory service shall:
        \begin{enumalph}
            \item \textit{advise} the aircraft to depart at the time specified and to cruise at the levels indicated in the flight plan if it does not foresee any conflict with other known traffic;
            \item \textit{suggest} to aircraft a course of action by which a potential hazard may be avoided, giving priority to an aircraft already in advisory airspace over other aircraft desiring to enter such advisory airspace; and
            \item \textit{pass} to aircraft traffic information comprising the same information as that prescribed for area control service.
        \end{enumalph}

        \item The criteria used as a basis for action under b) and c) above should be at least those laid down for aircraft operating in controlled airspace and should take into account the limitations inherent in the provision of air traffic advisory service, navigation facilities and air-ground communications prevailing in the region.
